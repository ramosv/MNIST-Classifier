# MNIST-Classifier


1. Write code to build a CNN with 4 convolutional layers, 4 pooling layers and 1 fully
connected layer.
Do a little experimentation and explain your choice of hyperparameters. What accuracy
to you get on the test set?
2. Build a feedforward neural network model (feel free to choose the number of layers,
etc.) and train it on MNSIT. How does the performance of the feedforward neural
network model compare to the CNN on the test set?
3. Given the MNSIT training data. Take half the size of the training data and train your
CNN. What is the effect on accuracy on the test set compared to part 1.? What happens
when you only train on 5% of the training data?
4. Given your trained CNN model on the training data. Take two images in the test set that
were previously correctly classified. Now add noise to the images (gaussian noise, salt
and pepper noise, etc.). Are you able to now fool the trained CNN? If yes, show which
images were fooled by the CNN. If not, provide a sample of the images you produced.
Report the noise parameters that you have tested.
